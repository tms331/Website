				Collection of coding projects that I have worked on. All C projects were done solely by me, java and python projects were done with a partner who is accredited 
				in the project files.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b><u>C Projects</u></b> - <u><a href = "https://github.com/tms331/C-Projects" style = "color: blue"> https://github.com/tms331/C-Projects </a></u>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&#128900; <u>balanced.c</u> - Program that will check if a given string of parentheses is balanced and nested correctly.
				<br>
				&nbsp;&#128900; <u>binSub.c</u> - Program that performs subtraction on two binary strings and returns the result.
				<br>
				&nbsp;&#128900; <u>binToFloat.c</u> - Program that converts binary string into a float.
				<br>
				&nbsp;&#128900; <u>bstLevelOrder.</u> - Program that traverses a binary search tree in level order (breadth first search)
				<br>
				&nbsp;&#128900; <u>greedyScheduling.c</u> - Program that uses a greedy algorithm in order to schedule as many jobs as possible without the times overlapping.
				<br>
				&nbsp;&#128900; <u>isTree.c</u> - Program that traverses and determines if a given structure is a tree.
				<br>
				&nbsp;&#128900; <u>rootFinder.c</u> - Program that estimates square root of given input (given the result and exponent)
				<br>
				&nbsp;&#128900; <u>toHex.c</u> - Program that converts binary string to hexadecimal
				<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp; <b><u>Java Projects</u></b> - <u><a href = "https://github.com/tms331/Java-Projects" style = "color: blue"> https://github.com/tms331/Java-Projects </a></u>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&#128900; The java folders linked below are divided into two projects that evolved over a semster that me and a partner worked on. 
				<b>Projects 1 - 3</b> we were tasked with creating a database for gym in which the user could query information as well as adding and deleting from the 
				database. <b>Projects 4 and 5</b> we were tasked with creating a pizza ordering system using java and javaFX in order to provide the user with GUI for 
				easily ordering customizable pizzas.
				<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp; <b><u>Python Projects</u></b> - <u><a href = "https://github.com/tms331/Python-Projects" style = "color: blue"> https://github.com/tms331/Python-Projects </a></u>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&#128900; This project was to create a basic AI, a "bot" that will reach a particular cell with a "button" that will put out a "fire". The project essentially was to
				play a game in which a fire and button are placed in random cells of a large "square" or 2d array. We were tasked with making different strategies for our bot
				that would best allow it to succeed in putting out a fire that would spread via reaching the button before the fire did or before the bot's death.
